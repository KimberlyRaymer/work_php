# work_php

Note: This program was converted from PHP to HTML, JavaScript, and Express JS

This program allows users to select input genomes and output genomes to reduce searching in a SQL database of genomes.
An SQL query is generated by using the selected radio buttons of the user and MySQL syntax.
A comparison is made by using the user's submitted genomes, whether that is by copying and pasting to the textarea or 
by uploading a text file, and the SQL generated list. All matches will be checked for, if there is no match then the 
similog column will be paired with "no correspondence". Users may download a csv file of the generated table.

Work Project

This particular project deals with reworking old php and html code. The previous designer had combined the html to the php file. The php code itself is an algorithm that parses through an SQL database for a specific genome type. However, this old design is quite poor and will be remade with an optimal algorithm that can handle 600,000 lines of code. Additionally, the html code will be put in a separate file and recreated from scatch to modernize the UI.
