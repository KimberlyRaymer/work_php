# work_php

Work Project

This particular project deals with reworking old php and html code. The previous designer had combined the html to the php file. The php code itself is an algorithm that parses through an SQL database for a specific genome type. However, this old design is quite poor and will be remade with an optimal algorithm that can handle 600,000 lines of code. Additionally, the html code will be put in a separate file and recreated from scatch to modernize the UI.
